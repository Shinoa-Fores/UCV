The Unobtanium Cryptographic Vault (UCV)

Unobtanium a la "therealbitcoin". This is a fork of the reference node project found here: (therealbitcoin.org , thebitcoin.foundation).

This is a retro version of Unobtanium. Command line only. Recommended for experts only. It syncs far slower than more common wallet versions.

This thing also builds statically with musl toolchain as described in therealbitcoin and related documentation. Staticly linked executable is here with signature.

This is a hardened war-ready full node and wallet for Unobtanium, for post-apocalypse and heavy battlefield use. Also can be used as reference implementation due to minimal external libraries.

Github is not guaranteed to be entirely reliable in such scenarios as those when this version becomes crucial to the network.
